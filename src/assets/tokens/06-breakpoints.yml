# Breakpoints
#
# These settings (in the form of a [Sass map](https://www.sitepoint.com/using-sass-maps/)) control the breakpoints for our media queries for responsive design.
#
# Applying the CSS generated by the example below, any element with the `.disclaimer` class would have a border when the browser width is less than the *medium* (`800px`) breakpoint, but would have no border when the browser is wider than that.
#
# $breakpoints = (xs: 400px, s: 600px, m: 800px, l: 1200px, xl: 1600px) - ​
#
# Markup:
# SCSS:
# .disclaimer {
#   border: $border-base;
#​
#   @include breakpoint(m) {
#     border: none;
#   }
# }
