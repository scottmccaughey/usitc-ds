# Shadows
#
# These settings are our default CSS shadows. Shadows are used very sparingly across our design system, but can occasionally be very useful.
#
# $shadows-box-base  = 0 $space-xxs $space-xxs 0 color(black)     - The default box shadow
# $shadows-box-focus = 0 0 $space-xxs $space-xxs color(cyan, 30)  - The box shadow we use when an element has focus
