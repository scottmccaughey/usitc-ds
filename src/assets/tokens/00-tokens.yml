# Tokens
#
# These are system-wide settings that have been converted from [YAML](http://yaml.org) files to Sass (<abbr>SCSS</abbr>) for use in USITC projects.
#
# Most settings can be overridden in your own Sass code by declaring the variable *before* importing the design system tokens.
#
# Tokens are also output in other formats for ease of use in various projects. Currently available formats are:
#
# * A TypeScript ES6 module at `dist/assets/tokens/tokens.ts`.
# * A NodeJS module at `dist/assets/tokens/tokens.js`.
# * A JSON file at `dist/assets/tokens/tokens.json`.
#
# Please send a request to the team if you would like to have these tokens in another format, such as CSS Custom Properties, LESS, Stylus, etc.
