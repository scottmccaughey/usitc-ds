  Breakpoints mixin

  @include breakpoint($point)

  The breakpoint() function takes a single required parameter. You must pass in the breakpoint
  name or a number ($point). If a breakpoint name is passed, the $breakpoints list as
  defined in _settings.scss (@section 3) is used for a mininum-width. If a number is passed,
  that number of pixels is used as a minimum-width.

  Ithis will cause any styles between the {} brackets to be applied only to
  screen sizes wider than the breakpoint passed:

  @include breakpoint(m) {
    font-size: 18px;
  }

  ...will set the font-size to '18px' on any screen larger than the medium breakpoint size.

  @include breakpoint(1024) {
    font-weight: bold;
  }

  ...will set the font-weight to 'bold' on any screen larger than 1024 pixels wide.

  String Replacement function

  str-replace($string, $search, $replace)

  The str-replace() function takes three parameters, the first two of which are required. You
  must pass the text to be modified ($string) and the text you want to replace ($search). The
  third (optional) parameter is the text you want to insert in place of the $search text
  ($replace). If the $replace parameter is not passed, the $search text will simply be
  removed. For example:

  .selector {
    $string: 'The answer to life, the universe and everything is blah.';
    content: str-replace($string, 'blah', '42');
  }

  ...will compile to the following CSS...

  .selector {
    content: 'The answer to life, the universe and everything is 42.';
  }

  This function is used in the Font Face Declaration mixin defined and documented in
  _directives.scss (@section 6).

  Font Face Declaration mixin

  fontdef($family, $type, $weight, $style, $stretch)

  Uses the $font-families list as defined in _settings.scss (@section 5a).

  The fontdef() mixin takes five parameters, the first two of which are required. You must pass
  the font family name ($family) and font variant name ($variant) to generate a @font-face
  definition.

  You can also pass an optional $weight [normal | 100 | 200 | ... | 800 | 900], $style
  [normal | italic], and $stretch [normal | ultra-condensed | extra-condensed | condensed |
  semi-condensed | semi-expanded | expanded | extra-expanded | ultra-expanded]. The optional
  variables will all default to 'normal' if they are not passed. The $stretch variable is
  currently not used in our design system, but is available for potential future use.

  For example:

  @include font-def(Fira Sans Condensed, semibolditalic, 600, italic, normal);

  ...will compile to the following CSS...

  @font-face {
    font-family: 'Fira Sans Condensed';
    src: url('../fonts/firasanscondensed-semibolditalic.woff') format('woff');
    font-weight: 600;
    font-style: italic;
    font-stretch: normal;
  }

  This function is used to generate @font-face declarations in _fonts.scss.

  Color Variations function

  color($key, $luminosity, $alpha)

  Uses the $colors list as defined in _settings.scss (@section 1a).

  The color() function takes three parameters, only the first of which is required. You must
  pass in the color name ($key) - this will render the base color:

    color(blue) - will render the BASE blue, equivalent to #3871c7 or rgba(56, 113, 199, 1)

  You may pass in an optional brightness variable ($luminosity), which can be any percentage,
  though it is recommended to use only multiples of ten: 10, 20, 30 ... 80, 90. The higher
  the number, the brighter the color:

    color(blue, 20) - will render a very DARK blue, equivalent to #162d50 or
                      rgba(56, 113, 199, 1)
    color(blue, 50) - will render the BASE blue, equivalent to #3871c7 or
                      rgba(56, 113, 199, 1)
    color(blue, 80) - will render a very LIGHT blue, equivalent to #afc6e9 or
                      rgba(56, 113, 199, 1)

  color(black) and color(white) are special cases in that their brightness is set by
  definition and cannot be adjusted:

    color(black) - is the same as color(grey, 0), equivalent to #000000 or
                    rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)
    color(white) - is the same as color(grey, 100), equivalent to #ffffff or
                    rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)

  You may pass in an optional opacity variable ($alpha), which can be any percentage, though
  it is recommended to use only multiples of ten: 10, 20, 30 ... 80, 90. If you want to use
  $alpha, you MUST also pass a $luminosity â€” it is recommended to always pass 50 so that you
  are creating only transparent versions of the BASE color. The higher the number, the more
  opaque the color:

    color(blue, 50, 20) -  will render a NEARLY TRANSPARENT base blue, equivalent to
                            rgba(56, 113, 199, 0.2)
    color(blue, 50, 50) -  will render a HALF TRANSPARENT base blue, equivalent to
                            rgba(56, 113, 199, 0.5)
    color(blue, 50, 100) - will render a COMPLETELY OPAQUE base blue, equivalent to
                            rgba(56, 113, 199, 1)

  Unlike brightness, opacity CAN be set on color(black) and color(white):

    color(black, 0, 20) -   will render a NEARLY TRANSPARENT black equivalent to
                            rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)
    color(white, 100, 50) - will render a HALF TRANSPARENT white, equivalent to
                            rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)
